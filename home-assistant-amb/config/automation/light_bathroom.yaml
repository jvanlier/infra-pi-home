  description: >
    Turn off the bathroom lights when no presence is detected on the first floor.

    This does not necessarily mean that the first floor is empty, it could simply be that everyone is in their bedroom.
    (There are no presence sensors in the bedrooms).

    This automation is needed because the motion sensor in the bathroom goes into dimmed state after dark.
    So there should be some mechanism to turn it off eventually.
