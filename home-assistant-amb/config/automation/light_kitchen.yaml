  description: >
    Turn off kitchen lights when no presence detected anymore, or it becomes sufficiently bright.

    The goal is to turn off lights that are in dimmed state, when that is no longer needed.
    Dimmed state assumed when lights are on but there is no motion-activated automation running.
