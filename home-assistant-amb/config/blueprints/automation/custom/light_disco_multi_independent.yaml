blueprint:
  name: Light Disco Multi Independent
  description: >
    Disco mode that cycles multiple individual lights independently,
    each with its own random timing. Unlike the standard disco blueprint
    which uses a single Zigbee group, this controls each light separately
    for more varied visual effects.
